# forkify-recipes

This project was created as a part of educational Javascript Course.

Using this small web application you can find different recipes according to the desired dish. The name of the dish please type
inside search area at the top of the window. After selecting a recipe on the left side you can configure your recipe changing
quantity of servings. So as not to forget what products are needed for cooking press "Add to shopping list" button and you can see it 
on the right.

The following technologies were used in this project:
- JS using ES6 (classes; forEach, map, findIndex array methods);
- JS code was divided into modules and controllers to make it more readable;
- Webpack, added configuration for SCSS, JS modules
- NPM, Babel
- SCSS, variables
- BEM methodology to make front-end code easier to read and understand, easier to work with, easier to scale and support
